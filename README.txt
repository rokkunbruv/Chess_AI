CHESS_AI by me created around June of 2023

- My technically second project if we consider my calculator program in C++ that makes use of the terminal as my first 
project and ignoring my second and third 'projects' which are the unfinished algorithm visualizer and that space invaders
knockoff without adding something new to the code respectively. Yeah i know it's going to be terrible considering I dont
have that much experience in making personal projects so do me a favor and make the code a lil bit efficient. Arigayto!
- Tho i mostly coded the whole thing by following through a tutorial, I tried my best to make this code my own by adding
in features the tutorial failed to cover, such as the undo feature and checkmates and stalemates, you know, as a learning
experience to revisit my forgotten knowledge on programming in Python (it's been a while since I've dabbled into Python)
and especially OOP.

FEATURES:
1. Player vs player mode
2. Computer mode (can only make random moves) that you can fight against (you'll probably win most of the time) or have
two computers fight against each other
3. Can do castling and en passant (i pray to God they're bugless)
4. Check, checkmate, and stalemate feature (draw feature currently being developed)
5. You can switch themes (yay colors)
6. The ability to drag pieces (you do have to drag them when you want to make a move)
7. An undo feature to fix all your mistakes, like your lif- (i pray to God the second time it'll be bugless)
8. The ability to record all the moves you and your opponent did.
